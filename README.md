## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training models using **labeled data**. The goal is to predict outputs for new, unseen data based on prior examples.

### Classification

Classification models categorize input data into predefined classes.

- **`iris_classifier.py`**: Classifies Iris flowers based on features like petal and sepal length/width.

### Regression

Regression models predict continuous values based on input features.

- **`linear_regression_scratch.py`**: Implements linear regression from scratch using numpy.  
- **`linear_regression_sklearn.py`**: Linear regression implementation using scikit-learn.  
- **`polynomial_regression.py`**: Demonstrates polynomial regression for non-linear relationships.

### Loss Functions

Loss functions measure how well a model predicts the target output.

- **`cross_entropy_loss.py`**: Cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.  
- **`mse_loss.py`**: Mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks.

### Train Test Split

- **`train_test_split.py`**: Custom implementation to divide dataset into training and testing sets.

---

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training models on **unlabeled data** to discover patterns, clusters, or lower-dimensional representations.

### Clustering

Clustering groups similar data points together.

- **`customer_segmentation.py`**: Clusters customers based on purchasing behavior.  
- **`hierarchical_clustering.py`**: Demonstrates hierarchical clustering techniques.  
- **`kmeans_basic.py`**: Basic K-Means clustering example.  
- **`kmeans_iris.py`**: Applies K-Means clustering to the Iris dataset.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction simplifies high-dimensional data while retaining important information.

- **`pca_basics.py`**: Introduction to Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  
- **`pca_on_iris.py`**: PCA applied to the Iris dataset for visualization and analysis.
